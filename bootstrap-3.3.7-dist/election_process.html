          <p class="lead">Presidential elections in the United States are held every four years, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Sound confusing? Basically, if the first day of November is a Tuesday, then the election will take place on the NEXT Tuesday, because there wasn't a Monday before the first Tuesday of the month. This year's election will be held on 8 November 2016.<br><br>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Presidential Primaries and Caucuses: <span class="text-muted">February-June 2016</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Voters are expected to register with their political party before these dates in order to vote in their party's primary or caucus. There are three main types of primaries that states generally hold, as well as a nominating caucus.<br><br>

		    <b>Open Primaries:</b> These allow all voters to cast a vote in a primary, regardless of their political affiliation. In essence, the only requirement you must fulfill to participate in this primary is being registered to vote.<br><br>

		    <b>Closed Primaries:</b> You may only participate in this primary if you are a registered member of that political party before the primary is held.<br><br>

		    <b>Semi&#8209;closed or Hybrid Primaries:</b> If a voter has not been previously affiliated with a political party, they are given the option to choose which party's primary they want to participate in. However, if a voter is already affiliated with a party they may only vote in that party's primary.<br><br>

		    <b>Nominating Caucus:</b> A small group of party leaders or a broader group of voters choose the party's nominee. Nominating caucuses are run by the party itself instead of the state or local governments, like primary elections are. The caucus process is not as widely used as primary elections, but over 10 states participate.<br><br>

		    <b>So what are the presidential primaries for? </b> Good question! The presidential primaries allow voters to select delegates to represent a candidate at the party's <a href = "#National Conventions">national convention</a>. The job of a delegate is to confirm voters' choice on the floor of the national convention.<br><br>

		    <b>Why is this important?</b> Primary election campaigns are the main way that voters get to know their candidates. What voters generally hear about are the platforms of the candidates, Republican vs Democrat. The third party candidates are also represented. The primaries provide a nationwide stage for free and open exchange of all ideas and opinions - the very definition of democracy. The delegates chosen during the primary elections are ultimately responsible for determining a party's presidential nominee.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">National Conventions<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
        <p class="lead">National conventions are held to finalize a party's choice for their Presidential nominee, determined by who has won the required number of delegates through the primaries and caucuses. At this time, the nominee also announces their choice of running mate. Conventions usually have guest speakers promoting the nominee. For a Democratic nomination, the candidate must win at least 2,383 out of the 4,765 Democratic delegates. For a Republic nomination, the candidate must win at least 1,237 out of the 2,472 Republican delegates.<br><br>

          <p class="lead">When you cast your vote for President, you are actually voting voting for a group of people called "electors". Political parties begin by selecting who will serve as electors.<br><br>

          <b>How the Electoral Map Works:</b> There are 538 total electors, of which a candidate needs 270 or more to win the Presidential election. Each state's number of electors are equal to the number of their U.S. senators plus the number of their U.S. Representatives. When a candidate receives the majority of votes in a state, they receive all electoral votes from the state.<br><br>
